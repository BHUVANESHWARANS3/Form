# studentform
Built a simple website using HTML, CSS AND JAVASCRIPT for DOM manipulation.
The website contains a form with input fields such as name, age, gender and so on.
After filling all the  fields and click the button, the student records will be shown below the tale with an option to delete a particular record.
Through this project, I have to learnt how to manipulate elements using javascript dom manipulation.
